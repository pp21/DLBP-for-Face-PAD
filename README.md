Introduction
============

This source code provides a simple implementation of DLBP in face PAD.
It is very easy to use and reproduce our work.


Usage
=====

The two core functions of this implementation

a) For the DLBP

Example:

F = dlbp(img, b, config, r, p, mappingtype);	% such as F = dlbp(img, 1, 1, 1, 8, 'u2');
	
This example returns the DLBP of the input image. Other parameters are described in dlbp.m.

b) For the directional difference image

Example:

d_img = getddi(img, b, config);		% such as d_img = getddi(img, 1, 1);	

This example returns the directional difference image of the input image. Other parameters are described in getddi.m.
